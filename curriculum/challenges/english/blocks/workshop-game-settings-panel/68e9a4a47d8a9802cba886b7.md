# --description--
Now that the body has been styled, you are going to create a container card for Game Settings panel. To start, you will need to create a class selector for `settings-card`.
This will be where all of your formating for the container will go. You will need to set the `max-width` to `250px`. This will define the overall size of our container.
Next, you will want to set your `padding` to `20px` so that your content has space between it and the border of the container.
After this, you are going to create a rounded edge by setting your `border-radius` to `10px`.
Then you will establish a `box-shadow` with the values of `0 2px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.2)`. This will create a subtle "lifted" look that will create depth for the container.
Finally, you will apply the `settings-card` class to your `div`.
