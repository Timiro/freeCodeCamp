# --description--

Next up, you are going to enlarge the checkboxes for better visibility. You'll start this with a comment of `make checkboxes bigger and assign cursor pointer`. This continues to keep your CSS organized as you have previously done.

Now you will begin by setting up an attribute selector for `input`, but specifically targetting your `[type='checkbox]`.

Within your attribute selector you will want to set the `width` and the `height` to `20px`. This makes it larger than it was before.

And to conform with your `cursor` setting that was set on the labels you are going to add `cursor` and assign the value of `pointer` to it. Now when you hover over the labels it will display a pointer.
