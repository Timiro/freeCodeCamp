# --description--

Now that your checkboxes change color when the user clicks them, you are going to apply some styling to make it a little more obvious that the checkbox has been selected.

First, you are going to create a new attribute selector of `input[type="checkbox"]` with the previous pseudo-class selector of `:checked` and add the pseudo-element selector of `:after`.
This will specifically target what happens after the user has checked the box.

Next, you are going add `content` with the value of `"✓"`.

Set the `display` to `block` and `text-align` to `center`.

After this, you'll want to set the `font-weight` for the check mark to be easier to see to `bold`. This will increase the visibility of the checkmark.

Now that this is easier to see, you'll want to change the `color` to a value of `white`. This is going to change the color of the checkmark within the checkbox when it is checked.

Lastly, you are going to alter the `line-height` to a value of `20px`.
